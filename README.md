## Installation

```bash
npm install -g messer
```

## Quick Start

1. Install `messer`
1. Run `messer` and enter your details
1. ...
1. Profit

## Setup

### Logging In

The preferred login method is to store your Facebook credentials in a file (default filepath is *./config.json*). Create a file as described below, and start `messer` with

```bash
messer [~/path/to/file]
```

```json
// config.json
{
  "email": "myfacebook@email.com",
  "password": "yourS3curePassw0rd"
}
```

### 2-Factor Authentication

1. Start Messer and wait for "Enter Code" prompt
2. Enter a 2FA code generated from your 2FA app

If at this point the login fails, go to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and check for an "Unrecognised browser" notification

3. Approve the browser/device (i.e. approve Messer)
4. Retry from Step 1

After you've successfully logged in, an `appstate.json` file is created which should allow you to skip this process every time you log in. If you wish to "start over", just delete that file.

This _shouldâ„¢_ work! Please let us know if it doesn't: we've had a number of issues with it in the past.

## Commands Reference

### message

Sends a _message_ to a given _user_

```bash
[message | m] "[user]" [message]
```

Examples

- `message "Matthew" hello world!`
- `m "Matthew" hello world!`

When sending a message, Messer picks the closest match to what you type in as `user`. For this reason, you should probably use last names if you want to avoid accidentally texting someone.

### reply

Replys to the last message you recevied i.e. Sends a message to the user of the most recently received message.

```bash
[reply | r] [message]
```

Example

- `r "hey yo this is my reply"`

Note: this will only work if you have received at least one message through Messer.

### contacts

Lists all of your Facebook friends

```bash
contacts
```

### history

Displays the last _n_ messages in the conversation with a given user. The number of messages to retrieve are optional (default is 5).

```bash
[history | h] "[user]" [numMessages]
```

Examples

- `history "Matthew" 10`
- `h "Matthew"`

### Group Chats

Messages from group chats appear like

```bash
(My cool friends) John Smith - hey guys!!$$@@
```

Send a message to a group by using the `message` command. The `name` is the name of the group chat! Reply works as normal
